# This script should be executed from within your fork of capk
#
# The script will...
# 1. automatically create remote branches for upstream and the openshift capk fork
# 2. create a new branch using the latest openshift capk fork's main
# 3. Merge upstream/main into the new branch, which layers in any upstream changes.
# 4. automatically resolve conflicts for expected file changes
# 5. validate upstream and downstream diff only contains expected file changes
# 6. push the new branch and automatically create a PR.
# 
# The script assumes the the gh cli is installed and authorized (download from here: https://cli.github.com/).
# The gh cli is required in order to auto create the PR
